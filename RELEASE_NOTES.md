We're proud to announce the new bug-fix release of darktable, 5.0.1!

The github release is here: [https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.0.1](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/releases/tag/release-5.0.1).

To build from source, do not use the autogenerated tarball provided by GitHub on the release page, download our tar.xz file instead. If you're just building for yourself without creating a package for some distribution, then using source code cloning in git is an even more convenient way.

The checksums are:

```
$ sha256sum darktable-5.0.1.tar.xz
??? darktable-5.0.1.tar.xz

$ sha256sum darktable-5.0.1-x86_64.dmg

$ sha256sum darktable-4.8.1-x86_64.AppImage
???  darktable-5.0.1-x86_64.AppImage
```

When updating from the stable 4.8 series, please bear in mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new library and configuration will no longer be usable with 4.8.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to Darktable
5.0. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
changes (where available).

- N/A

## UI/UX Improvements

- N/A

## Performance Improvements

- Improved performance of discarding history of selected images.

- Center collapsible module section labels.

## Other Changes

- Harmonized style selection in print settings with the update made in
  the export module for release 5.0.

- Darktable now includes the Lensfun database into the AppImage.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a scrolling bug in the collections module where the collection
  tree was not scrolled to the previous position when returning from
  darkroom.

- Fix crash when attempting to move up the top or only shape in a
  group in the mask manager.

- Fix collection module when using the "module" filter which was
  listing none of the processing modules.

- Fix iop-order user presets use. It was not possible to get a user's
  iop-order preset to be applied as the Darktable internal presets
  where always picked up first.

- Fixed a crash in variable expansion for $(SEQUENCE[n,m]).

- Fixed handling on click from filmstrip when in map and print
  view. On map we now properly center the image on the map. On the
  print view, we use the selected image as content of the main print
  area.

- Fixed a regression introduced in 5.0.0 where we lost the ability to
  read 2-channel TIFF files and files with more than 4 channels. This
  fix allows them to be read by the TIFF loader, whereas previously
  the TIFF loader rejected such files and they were loaded by a
  fallback loader (GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick).

- Fixed not being able to pan with a mouse in the zoomable layout.

- Fixed possibly collapsing the module header when restoring defaults.

- Fixed a case of XMP being written without actual image modification.

- Fixed a crash of Darktable when reimporting XMP having overlay
  images referenced.

- Fixed the support for single lib module opened at a time when in
  darkroom.

- Fixed xmp sidecar writing while working as a gimp plugin.

- Fixed issues when applying a style in darkroom using the Styles
  module.

- Fixed a possible crash when using <kbd>Ctrl+z</kbd> reproduced on
  macOS.

- Fixed Darktable crashing in enlarge-canvas module.

- Fixed Darktable crashing using details mask due to bad tiling.

- Fixed a hash calculation bug leading to pixelpipe instabilities.

- Fixed issue to handle auto-presets when the focal length is greater
  then 1000.

- Fixed crash on macOS when closing the darkroom's second window.

- Fixed possible jump in filmstrip when entering darkroom from full
  preview.

- Fixed a performance regression in haze removal module.

- Fixed reading palette-based PNG with transparency.

- Fixed possible crash in lens correction module when changing camera
  and/or lens model.

- Fixed crash after deleting style or preset that was selected in
  shortcuts dialog.

- Fixed a crash when the currently active module instance is being
  deleted.
